# FAST: Optimized threading  for fast annotation

Comparative genomic research relies heavily on protein alignment to infer the metabolic potential of an organism or community. Local Alignment Search Tool LAST, uses adaptive seed lengths to gain approximately 50 times the speed of standard seed-and-extend algorithm BLAST. However, LAST is currently capable of utilizing a single CPU. Here, we present FAST, a multi-threaded, IO optimized implementation of LAST that uses a model for algorithmic thread synchronization to allow efficient use of multiple CPU processes while requiring only 4-8GB of memory. We demonstrate that FAST is approximately 6-times faster than LAST using real world environmental data with > 50,000 sequences, and show that FAST is over 2-times faster than DIAMOND, the fastest available aligner prior to FAST. Finally, we implement new features such as the calculation of BLAST like e-values, and tabular format outputs compatible with multiple downstream analyses tools.
